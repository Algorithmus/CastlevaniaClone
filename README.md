GodotEngine Castlevania-like classic platformer demo

This is just demo code that demonstrates what GodotEngine can do. It is modelled after classic retro gaming 2D platformer games like Castlevania SOTN, except with one way platforms, ledge climbing and ladders. It does not make heavy use of the built-in 2D physics engine, so much of the behavior is programmed by hand. Much of that behavior and the algorithms involved are taken from [this guide](http://higherorderfun.com/blog/2012/05/20/the-guide-to-implementing-2d-platformers/comment-page-1/#comments) (use archive.org if the link doesn't work). Read source code comments for implementation specific details.
